    base-convert is a shell script that converts its numeric argument from
    one base to another, depending on the name by which the script was
    invoked.  For example:

        Convert binary 101010 to decimal:

            $ ./b2d 101011
            43

        Convert octal 755 to hexadecimal:
    
            $ ./o2h 755
            1ED
        
        The scripts can be pipelined:

            $ echo 101010 | ./b2o | ./o2h | ./h2d
            42

    The enclosed Makefile creates the 12 permutations of binary, octal, 
    decimal and hexadecimal (b2d, d2o, h2b, etc.) as hard links.
